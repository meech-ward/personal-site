My name is Sam Meech-Ward and I'm the Head iOS Instructor at [Lighthouse Labs](http://lighthouselabs.ca/), a software development bootcamp based in Vancouver, BC. I started developing iOS apps 9 years ago (iphone os3) when 3G was new and cool, the	Black Eyed Peas had just released "Boom Boom Pow", and iOS developers only had to worry about one single screen size. In that time, I have also obtained a degree in web design and development and gained increasing interest in The Internet of Things.

## Programming

I like to write code so I guess that makes me a programmer. It all started 9 year ago when I wanted to make apps for my iPhone 3g, so the first programming language I ever used was Objective-C. I mean I had touched some HTML and JavaScript here and there, but I really feel that Objective-C was the first programming language I actually learned.

There's a reason that Objective-C became so popular in 1980, it was the only Object Oriented option for C developers. Then C++ was released in 1985 and Objective-C *should* have probably died, but unfortunately, by chance, Next and later Apple, adopted this interesting language into everything they did. In 2018, Objective-C has no place in anyone's skill set, and is becoming a pretty useless language. That being said, Objective-C is my *strongest* language and the last language I would willingly choose to program with. 

After Objective-C my strongest language is Swift, followed by JavaScript. These are the languages that I currently get paid to teach people.

* web JS
