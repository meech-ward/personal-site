My name is Sam Meech-Ward and I'm the Head iOS Instructor at [Lighthouse Labs](http://lighthouselabs.ca/), a software development bootcamp based in Vancouver, BC. I started developing iOS apps 9 years ago (iphone os3) when 3G was new and cool, the	Black Eyed Peas had just released "Boom Boom Pow", and iOS developers only had to worry about one single screen size. In that time, I have also obtained a degree in web design and development and gained increasing interest in The Internet of Things.
