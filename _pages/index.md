Hi, my name is Sam Meech-Ward, I make things with code and I teach other people how to do the same. I currently spend most of my professional time instructing, mentoring, and developing curriculum for the iOS and Web programs at [Lighthouse Labs](http://lighthouselabs.ca/), a software development Bootcamp based in Vancouver, BC. 

I started developing iOS apps 10 years ago when 3G was so new and cool that apple named their 3rd iPhone after it. In that time, I have also obtained a degree in web design and development, I have worked as an iOS and Web developer, I've taught people how to program, and so much more.
