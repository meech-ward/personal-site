Hi, my name is Sam Meech-Ward, I make things with software and I teach other people how to do the same. I currently spend most of my professional time Instructing, Mentoring, and developing curriculum for the iOS and Web programs at [Lighthouse Labs](http://lighthouselabs.ca/), a software development bootcamp based in Vancouver, BC. 

I started developing iOS apps 10 years ago when 3G was so new and cool that apple named a phone after it. In that time, I have also obtained a degree in web design and development and

My favorite thing to do right now is make "smart" things with JavaScript and a raspberry pi. 


, the	Black Eyed Peas had just released "Boom Boom Pow", and iOS developers only had to worry about one single screen size.
