title: "Let's Build a Temperature Sensor with a Raspberry Pi Part 1"
---

{:.flow-text}
This is a two part project. In part one, we connected a raspberry pi to a temperature & humidity sensor so that we could read the current temperature. In [Part 2](/youtube_projects/02_raspberry-pi-temperature-sensor-part-2.html), we setup the pi to emit the temperature and humidity data using BLE. We also made an iPhone app that can read that data.
