This is part two of the two part temperature sensor tutorial. Make sure you check out [Part 1](/youtube_projects/01_raspberry-pi-temperature-sensor-part-1.html) first. 

In part 2, we setup the pi to emit the temperature and humidity data using BLE. We also made an iPhone app that can read that data.
