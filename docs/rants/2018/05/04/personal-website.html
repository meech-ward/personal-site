    <p>Building a personal website is, for some reason, a really wierd thing to do. Ask me to build a website for your new startup “Uber for vegan cats” and we can get down to business talking about features. But ask me to build myself a personal website, and… 😳</p>

<p>Right now, I am sitting here trying to update my personal website, and instead I’m procrastinating and writing a blog post.</p>

<p>I mean, it doesn’t seem like a difficult task, just make a site, that’s about you. But for some reason, it’s a task that most developers struggle with. This is what my personal website has looked like for the past 4 years.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/z1KTlVW.png" alt="personal website" /></p>

<h3 id="who-is-the-site-even-for">Who is the site even for?</h3>

<p>That’s a pretty valid question, if i’m building a website, who the hell is it for? Is it for me? Am I building a personal site so that I can visit it for myself to find out more information about myself? That doesn’t sound right, so I don’t think the site is not for me.</p>

<p>Is it for friends and family? Probably not, I mean when was the last time anyone looked at a friend’s personal website?</p>

<p>Random people on the internet? Maybe I guess. I mean my personal website isn’t the worst thing on the internet. If someone was procrastinating for long enough, then maybe they would come across it. Maybe they would be like “Oh this guy looks cool, maybe we could be friends”.</p>

<p>Potential employers? This one sounds good, but what if I’m already employed? Does that make my personal site completely useless?  and potential employers, which are really just random people on the internet.</p>

<p>So my site is for random people on the internet.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-i-put-on-my-site">What do I put on my site?</h3>

<p>What do people who don’t know me want to know about me? Hobbies, passions, favorite food, flossing schedule? Do I just brag about the cool stuff, or include my downfalls? Is this site to entertain people or just make me look good?</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-create-the-site">How do I create the site</h3>

<p>Cool tech, wordpress, jekyll?
design, or template, or what?</p>

<h3 id="does-it-even-matter-in-the-end">Does it even matter in the end</h3>

<p>Personally, I don’t think so. But just incase it does <a href="http://sammeechward.com">SamMeechWard.com</a></p>
